Now the next step is to make sure the ML filter is doing real work (not just “trained”) and that your live engine is logging what it’s skipping/taking.

What to do next (in Replit)
1) Verify the model is actually being used in live trading

Go to Live Trading → Start and confirm you see at least one of these:

A visible “ML confidence” number on the page, OR

Journal entries like:

“Skipped trade: low confidence”

“Trade executed (paper) – confidence 0.xx”

If you don’t see either, the engine isn’t calling the predictor yet (even if the API says trained).

2) Turn on “proof logs” (fastest confirmation)

In your live engine code right where you compute confidence, write to the journal every decision:

When signal is BUY/SELL: log confidence + threshold + decision (TAKE/SKIP)

When signal is HOLD: log HOLD + confidence (optional)

This gives undeniable visibility.

3) Calibrate the threshold (70% is fine, but test)

Run paper trading for ~30–50 signals and compare:

Threshold 0.60 → more trades, more noise

Threshold 0.70 → balanced

Threshold 0.80 → fewer trades, often cleaner

Goal: lower drawdown + higher win rate (not just higher confidence).

The “professional” validation step (so you don’t overfit)

Even with 105k bars, you must validate properly:

A) Out-of-sample split

Train on first 70%

Test on last 30%
Track:

accuracy

precision/recall

AUC

profit-based metric (best)

B) Walk-forward

Train → trade next window → roll forward.
This matches live conditions.

C) Reality check

If your dataset label is “next candle up/down,” accuracy will usually hover near 50–55% because FX is noisy. That’s normal — profitability comes from:

filtering only the best setups

risk control

Before Windows / real MT5

Keep these safety rules:

✅ PAPER_TRADING=true
✅ MAX_DAILY_LOSS_PCT active
✅ MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS low (1–2)
✅ spread filter enabled
✅ journal logging on every decision

Quick question (so I give the exact next instruction)

When you start Live Trading, do you see any ML confidence value on the page or in the journal?

Reply:
“Yes, I see confidence logs”
or
“No, I don’t see confidence logs”
